            <p>
                When you create an account we collect your email, password, and some information about your goal. This is done to help you reach others with similar journeys easily and make your journey more interesting and easier to walk. We also store sessions to keep you logged in longer and to personalize your experience. About sensitive information like emails, we do not share this information with anyone. The reasons we collect your email are, that we need to ensure that you only create one account, make it possible for you to change your password, and for us to remind you in case you get off track.
