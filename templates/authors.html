                I am a hard-working and dedicated student from South Africa. I study Economics but I take Computer Science courses online and teach myself programming for every second I get. I started learning how to program by the end of February 2022. I began with the CS50's Introduction to Computer Science course. In the past few months, I have learned computational thinking, abstraction, data structures, algorithms, web development, and how to be a better programmer.

                I focus on both front-end and back-end development. I can create responsive, mobile-friendly, and high-quality websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap on the front end. On the back end, I use Python with the Flask framework and SQLite3 for databases.

                I am a big tech enthusiast who fell in love with logic and programming. I started my journey in to programming in 2020 when I first discovered CS50. Two years later, I am about to get my bachelors in Computer Science. I could have not achieved all these things without the solid foundation acquired in CS50 lectures. I am currently enrolled in CS50 Python as well and enjoying every bit of it. I plan to continue learning about computer programming and using all the resources provided by Harvard University in its CS50 program.
